# ChickiFarm

ChickiFarm is an NFT-based playground where every holder can enjoy various experiences. Our platform provides services such as social-networking, games, raffles, shopping, and customizing your own NFT space.

## About

NFTs have been all the rage for a while, and as of today, approximately 26 million people hold at least one NFT in a 3 billion dollar market.

However, the truth is that technically, there’s **no place to make use of your NFTs**. You buy one, maybe use it as your profile picture, but then what? NFT use cases were scarce, and that’s bad news for everyone in the industry.

It comes in a whole action-packed, fun-filled assortment of activities to do.
